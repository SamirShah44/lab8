/**
 * @file    CSZNode.cpp
 * @brief   Implementation of the CSZNode class, which represents nodes in a 
 *          binary search tree for managing city, state, and ZIP code data.
 *
 * This file contains the method implementations for the CSZNode class, 
 * including functions for setting and retrieving child nodes, accessing node 
 * data, comparing nodes, and outputting node information to a stream. The 
 * CSZNode class is designed to work with a CityStateZip structure and to be 
 * compatible with a binary search tree structure, where nodes are ordered 
 * based on city name.

 *              Specifically, the function returns true if the city name

 *              city name in op2.
 *
 * @remarks     This function is useful for ordering nodes in a binary search 
 *              tree by city name. It does not modify the contents of either 
 *              node.
